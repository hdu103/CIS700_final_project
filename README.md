# 1. CIS700_final_project
# 2. Huaguang Du, ver 1.0, Number sorting with NTP 
# 3. This project contains four files, project_try_4.py, CNN_testdata.py, CNN.pkl, CNN.py
# 4. CNN.py is used for training the CNN and save to CNN.pkl, so we don't need CNN.py for this project. 
#    All CNN parameters have already saved in CNN.pkl
# 5. CNN_testdata.py is used for getting the training data. I imported the MNIST hand writting number 
#    database and get the function from MNIST
# 6. project_try_4.py is my main structure, I have trained the CNN in advance in CNN.py file. I load 
#    CNN and get data use the function from CNN_testdata.py file. Then get the training data and testing
#    data and get the label to train and test the core network(LSTM) and show the result(loss & error)
